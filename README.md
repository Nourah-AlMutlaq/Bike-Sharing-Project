# Bike-Sharing Project

## Project Source

This repository contains project#1 related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree program](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-bikesharing). 

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

## Dataset

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
